## Services

The platform currently consists of three core services:

### 1. IO Service
Handles all core platform data, including videos, users, and comments. This service acts as the primary backend responsible for data storage and retrieval.

### 2. Encoding Service
Processes uploaded media files by encoding videos and images into multiple resolutions and chunks. This enables efficient streaming and adaptive bitrate playback.

### 3. Client
The frontend application of the platform. It allows users to upload content, browse videos, watch streams, and interact through comments.
